I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Purdue University, where I am a part of the [XR Lab](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/xrlab/), advised by [Voicu Popescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/popescu/). I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Ocean University of China.

My research focuses on **XR (AR/VR/MR), Computer Graphics, and Human–AI Interaction**, with an emphasis on immersive 3D visualization, haptic retargeting, cross-reality interaction, and multi-agent systems.

Outside of my research, I love playing badminton 🏸, exploring new destinations 🗺, and savoring great food 😋!

I also have a lovely cat named Pixel 😸!
