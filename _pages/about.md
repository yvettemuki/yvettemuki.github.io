I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University, where I am a part of the [XR Lab](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/xrlab/), advised by [Voicu Popescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/popescu/). I completed my Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Ocean University of China.

My research focuses on **XR (AR/VR/MR), Computer Graphics, and HCI**, with an emphasis on immersive 3D visualization, haptic retargeting, cross-reality systems, and LLM-based agent frameworks for XR.

Outside of my research, I love playing badminton üè∏, exploring new destinations üó∫, and savoring great food üòã!

I also have a lovely cat named Pixel üò∏!
