I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University, where I am a member of the [XR Lab](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/xrlab/), advised by [Voicu Popescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/popescu/). I previously earned my Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue, and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ocean University of China.

My research focuses on **Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR) and Computer Graphics**, particularly in immersive 3D visualization, haptic retargeting, cross-reality system. I aim to break the boundary between the virtual and real worlds, creating seamless experiences that bridge these environments.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing badminton üè∏, traveling üó∫, and playing FPS games like Overwatch üéÆ! 

I also have a lovely cat named Pixel üò∏!
