I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Purdue University. My research focuses on Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR), with a particular interest in bridging the gap between the virtual and physical worlds using graphics and 3D visualization techniques.
