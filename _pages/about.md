I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Purdue University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Voicu Popescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/popescu/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Graphics Technology Depertment, also at Purdue. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Ocean University of China.

My research is centered on **AR/VR/MR** and **Graphics**, especially on immersive 3D visualization, Occlusion Management and 3D reconstruction.
