I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Purdue University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Voicu Popescu. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Graphics Technology Department, also at Purdue. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Ocean University of China.

My research is centered on **AR/VR/MR** and **Graphics**, especially on immersive 3D Visualization, Occlusion Management and 3D Reconstruction.
